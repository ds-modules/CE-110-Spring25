**Module for Civil Engineering**

**Instructor: Jennifer S. Draut, Kara L. Nelson**

The goal of this module is to vizualize California water networks and examine the differences in the network across years. We will go over basic concepts in Python, map local networks and water flow surrounding specific utilities, and analyze the the differences in volume of water transported as well as amount of energy consumed by utilies between 2010 and 2015. We will assess how well these metrics for 2015 were predited in 2010 and make sense of the changes in water flow and energy consumption in the context of the California drought.
